# ERC-20 & NFT Indexer

Taken from skeleton app that uses the Alchemy SDK rigged to Alchemy's Enhanced APIs in order to display all of an address's ERC-20 token balances and owned NFTs

## Set Up

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Start application by running `npm run dev`

## Feature list (with progress colours)
